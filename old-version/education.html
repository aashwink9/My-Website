    Educational Background
  </h1>

  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Being born in India, I completed my education till
  highschool in my hometown. I live in a city called Raipur, Chhattisgarh. I was admitted
  to many schools before I reached the 5th grade, where I completed my school education in the
  same school.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 25px;">I started my education from a school called Angel's Nursery in my hometown Raipur, where I completed my
    preschool, and then when my parents moved to another neighbouring city, I got admitted to another school
    called St. Xaviers, where I completed my Kindergarden. After my parents moved back to Raipur,
    I got admitted to a different school called Holy Hearts Educational Academy, where I was only for the duration of
    two years: the fourth grade and the fifth grade. In the middle of completing the fifth grade,
    I finally moved to N.H. Goel World School in my hometown, where I completed the rest of
    my education. Starting from the seventh grade (middle school), I realized my passion for computers, however
    I was also active in a variety of clubs, like the sports soccer club, the chess club and the Music club
    where I started to learn to play a guitar.
  <p style="font-size: 25px;"> In the 11th grade (highschool), when we were finally allowed to choose our desired subjects,
    I chose a Computer Science and Science bundle where the Science section included
    Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. I started learning more and more about computers, and
    started to get more into video games as well. It was after completing my 12th grade that I realized I wanted
    to go to the United States and pursue my education in computer science, as it had a variety of
    different fields and combinations that one wouldn't find in colleges in India. So that is my educational
    story, and moving forward, I hope I am able to learn more in this field and do something
    that would contribute to the world in a major, impactful way.
